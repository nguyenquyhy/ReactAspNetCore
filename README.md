## React & ASP.NET Core

This is my custom template for using React with ASP.NET Core. 

I start this from a basic ASP.NET Core MVC template and then add in components of a React app. I try to focus each commit to a single feature so it might be easier to learn by looking at the changes.

The reasonale and some analysis of this template is in my blog post https://www.nguyenquyhy.com/2019/04/react-asp-net-core/.
